COCO clicker game with TON wallet integration, smart contract functionality, and all the requested features. I'll provide the correct code for each part of the game. Let's break this down into multiple components and files.

Let's start by creating the main game component and the necessary files:

```typescriptreact project="CocoClickerGame"
...
```

This implementation includes all the requested features:

1. COCO character clicking
2. Upgrade shop with three upgrades (Magic Wand, Garden Helper, Mushroom Farm)
3. Real-time stats tracking
4. Visual feedback on clicks
5. TON wallet connection using TonConnect
6. Smart contract integration for game logic and state persistence
7. COCO coin purchase functionality
8. Wallet-specific game state


To use this game:

1. Connect your TON wallet using the TonConnect button
2. Click on the COCO character to earn coins
3. Purchase upgrades to increase your clicking power and passive income
4. Use the CocoPurchase component to buy more COCO coins with TON


Make sure to deploy the smart contract and replace the contract address in the `useCocoContract` hook with your deployed contract address.

To run the game locally:

1. Install the necessary dependencies:

```plaintext
npm install @tonconnect/ui-react @orbs-network/ton-access ton-core ton
```


2. Set up your environment variables:
Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add:

```plaintext
NEXT_PUBLIC_TON_NETWORK=testnet
```


3. Start the development server:

```plaintext
npm run dev
```


4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`


Remember to deploy your smart contract to the TON blockchain before running the game. You can use tools like `ton-cli` or `tondev` to deploy the `CocoGame` contract.

To further enhance the game, consider implementing these additional features:

1. Leaderboard system:

1. Add a new component to display top players
2. Modify the smart contract to store and retrieve leaderboard data



2. Referral rewards:

1. Implement a referral system where players can invite friends
2. Add bonus rewards for successful referrals



3. More sophisticated tokenomics:

1. Introduce different types of COCO coins (e.g., regular and premium)
2. Implement a burning mechanism to control inflation



4. Achievements and badges:

1. Create a system to track player achievements
2. Award special badges for reaching milestones



5. Daily rewards:

1. Implement a daily login bonus system
2. Add time-limited events with special rewards





By continuously improving and expanding the game, you can create a more engaging and rewarding experience for your players while leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology.
